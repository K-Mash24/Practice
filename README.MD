This is a repository specifically to be used when i decided to relearn web development from scratch since previously I relied too much on AI to do the work for me. So this is an attempt to become a fullstack developer.

## Goals

1. Build strong foundational skills in frontend development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React) by completing 25 days of deep practice and shipping at least 2 small projects by the time the semester opens on August 20th 2025.
